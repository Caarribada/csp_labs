            <h1><strong>J.K Rowling</strong></h1>
            <p id="1"><strong>Joanne Rowling </strong><em>CH OBE HonFRSE FRCPE FRSL (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/
                    ROH-ling;</em><sup>[1]</sup> born 31 July 1965), is a British author and philanthropist known by her
                pen name J. K. Rowling. She wrote a seven-volume children's fantasy series, Harry Potter, published from
                1997 to 2007. The series has been enormously successful: it has sold over 500 million copies, been
                translated into at least 70 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video
                games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing
                crime fiction series, as <strong>Robert Galbraith</strong>.</p>

            <p>Born in Yate, Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1987 and began working temp jobs
                as a bilingual secretary. In 1990, the idea for the characters of <em>Harry Potter</em> came to her
                while she waited on a delayed train. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother
                from multiple sclerosis, which deeply affected Rowling and her writing; the birth of her first child;
                and divorce from her first husband. She wrote the first Harry Potter novel, <em>Harry</em> Potter and
                the Philosopher's Stone (1997), while experiencing relative poverty as a single parent. Forbes named her
                the world's highest-paid author in 2008, 2017 and 2019.</p>

            <p>Rowling concluded the <em>Harry Potter</em> series with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
                (2007). The novels follow a boy named Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts, a school for wizards, and
                battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series.
                Its influences include the Bildungsroman (coming-of-age story), school stories, fairy tales, and
                Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of
                imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see
                Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as
                regressive. There were also religious debates over Harry Potter.</p>

                <h2><strong>Name</strong></h2>
                <p id="2">Although she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, before her remarriage her name was
                    Joanne Rowling, or Jo. At birth, she had no middle name. Staff at Bloomsbury Publishing asked that
                    she use two initials rather than her full name, anticipating that young boys – their target audience
                    – would not want to read a book written by a woman. She chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial
                    of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother, and because of the ease of pronunciation of two
                    consecutive letters. Following her 2001 remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray
                    when conducting personal business</p>

                <h3><strong>Early life and family</strong></h3>

                <p id="3">Joanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965 at Cottage Hospital in Yate. Her parents Anne (née
                    Volant) and Peter "Pete" James Rowling had met the previous year on a train, sharing a trip from
                    King's Cross Station, London, to their naval postings at Arbroath, Scotland. Anne was in the WREN
                    and Pete was with the British Royal Navy.They came from middle-class backgrounds; Pete was the son
                    of a machine-tool setter who later opened a grocery shop. They left the navy life and sought a
                    country home to raise the baby they were expecting, and married on 14 March 1965 when both were 19.
                    The Rowlings settled in Yate, where Pete started work as an assembly-line production worker at the
                    Bristol Siddeley factory. Pete's company became part of Rolls-Royce, and he worked his way into
                    management as a chartered engineer. Anne later worked as a science technician. Neither Anne nor Pete
                    attended university.</p>

                <p>Joanne has a sister, Dianne, two years younger than her. When Joanne was four, the family moved to
                    Winterbourne, Gloucestershire. She began at St Michael's Church of England Primary School in
                    Winterbourne when she was five. The Rowlings lived near a family called Potter – a name Joanne
                    always liked. Anne loved to read and their homes were filled with books. Pete read The Wind in the
                    Willows to his daughters, while Anne introduced them to the animals in Richard Scarry's books.
                    Joanne's first attempt at writing, a story called "Rabbit" composed when she was six, was inspired
                    by Scarry's creatures.</p>

                <p>When Rowling was about nine, the family purchased the historic Church Cottage in Tutshill. In 1974,
                    Rowling began attending the nearby Church of England School. Biographer Sean Smith describes her
                    teacher Sylvia Morgan as a "battleaxe" who "struck fear into the hearts of the children"; she seated
                    Rowling in "dunces' row" after she performed poorly on an arithmetic test. In 1975, Rowling joined a
                    Brownies pack. Its special events and parties, and the pack groups (Fairies, Pixies, Sprites, Elves,
                    Gnomes and Imps) provided a magical world away from the stern Morgan.When she was eleven or twelve,
                    she wrote a short story, "The Seven Cursed Diamonds".She later described herself during this period
                    as "the epitome of a bookish child – short and squat, thick National Health glasses, living in a
                    world of complete daydreams".</p>

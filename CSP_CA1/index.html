            <h1><strong>J.K Rowling</strong></h1>
            <p id="1"><strong>Joanne Rowling </strong><em>CH OBE HonFRSE FRCPE FRSL (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/
                    ROH-ling;</em><sup>[1]</sup> born 31 July 1965), is a British author and philanthropist known by her
                pen name J. K. Rowling. She wrote a seven-volume children's fantasy series, Harry Potter, published from
                1997 to 2007. The series has been enormously successful: it has sold over 500 million copies, been
                translated into at least 70 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video
                games. The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults. She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing
                crime fiction series, as <strong>Robert Galbraith</strong>.</p>

            <p id="2">Born in Yate, Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1987 and began working temp jobs
                as a bilingual secretary. In 1990, the idea for the characters of <em>Harry Potter</em> came to her
                while she waited on a delayed train. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother
                from multiple sclerosis, which deeply affected Rowling and her writing; the birth of her first child;
                and divorce from her first husband. She wrote the first Harry Potter novel, <em>Harry</em> Potter and
                the Philosopher's Stone (1997), while experiencing relative poverty as a single parent. Forbes named her
                the world's highest-paid author in 2008, 2017 and 2019.</p>

            <p id="3">Rowling concluded the <em>Harry Potter</em> series with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
                (2007). The novels follow a boy named Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts, a school for wizards, and
                battles Lord Voldemort. Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series.
                Its influences include the Bildungsroman (coming-of-age story), school stories, fairy tales, and
                Christian allegory. The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of
                imitators, and inspired an active fandom. Critical reception has been more mixed. Many reviewers see
                Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as
                regressive. There were also religious debates over Harry Potter.</p>
